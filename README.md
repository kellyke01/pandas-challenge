In this challenge I was able to run accurate summarys for the district of the total number of unique schools.
The number of students total, the budget total, the averages of the math and reading scores.
The codes provided helped me figure out the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both of them together.
Then I created a new dataframe for the new calculation and called it district_summary

I then used the code provided in the module assignment to select the school type and then calculated the total students per school.
I was able to provide the number of schools with math scores or 70 or higher along with the reading scores and both scores combined.
The data collected was then placed into a new dataframe called per_school_summary

From there I took the % overall passing in descending order and saved the dataframe as top_schools.
I referenced the first 5 rows.
I was able to do the same thing for the lowest rating schools and showed the first 5 rows of that dataframe as well.

I was able to reference the codes provided to me to separate the data by grade level. From there I referenced the mean of the reading scores and math scores and called them into their own dataframes.
I was able to look at the spending ranges of each school and calculate the averages of those in order to create a dataframe using the binned and averaged spending data that was called in the outputs.

I grouped the per_school_summary by school type and averaged those results.
I placed them into a new dataframe called type_summary.

I was able to reference Dr. A's videos to work through this rather extensive and lengthy challenge. 
I was able to run all of my outputs with no hiccups.
